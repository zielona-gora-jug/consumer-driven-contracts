# Consumer-Driven Contracts
Project contains simple CDC implementation, from JUG presentation (21.12.2016) about Consumer-Driven Contracts.
It shows how to use a [Spring Cloud Contract Verifier](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract)
on `client` and `server` side.

To run it just execute:

`./gradlew clean build`

Have fun!
